- Social Image has started to develope direct manipulation of editable design tools like Powerpoint, We've developed it with reactjs, ant.design, fabricjs

- Layouts and components such as property edits, item lists, toolbars were developed as react.js and the ant.design component was **primarily** used.

- The project is constantly being developed to support a variety of functions, and its goal is to be able to draw workflow (BPMN) in the future.
